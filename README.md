# To-Do List App

## Overview

This To-Do List app is a dynamic and responsive project created using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my skills in building interactive web applications with features such as theme switching, animations, and dynamic messaging.

## Key Features

- **Light and Dark Modes**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for different devices.
- **Custom Animations**: Dynamic animations for To-Do items.
- **Dynamic Popup Messaging**: Real-time feedback with customizable popups.

## Animation Handling

The app includes a flexible animation system managed through JavaScript and CSS. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how animations are handled:

### JavaScript Animation Function

The `animationStatus` function allows you to apply CSS animations to specific To-Do items dynamically.

}
